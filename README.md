### I used ChatGPT for my LLM

### My Question:
My frist question was how are programming languages designed. From here I asked what is the difference betweeen compiled and interpreted languages. Next, I asked if compiled languages are faster and easier to catch errors what is the benefit of interpreted languages. Finally I asked why are interpreted languages better for machine learning.

## My First Question

### How are Programming Languages Created?

## Response:
Programming languages are created through a combination of design, theory, and engineering. The process typically involves several steps:
## 1. Purpose and Design Goals:
* **Define the Purpose:** The creators start by identifying the purpose of the language. Some languages are created for general-purpose use (like Python or Java), while others target specific tasks, such as web development (JavaScript), system programming (C), or data analysis (R).
* **Design Principles:** These include deciding whether the language will prioritize performance, ease of use, flexibility, or safety. Trade-offs are made based on the target audience and use cases.
